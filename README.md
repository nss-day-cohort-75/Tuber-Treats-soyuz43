# ðŸ¥” TuberTreats API

TuberTreats is a simple .NET 8 Web API simulating a baked potato delivery service. It uses an in-memory data store (`FakeDataStore`) to manage Customers, Orders, Drivers, Toppings, and their relationships. This project serves as a practice ground for RESTful API design using **ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs**.
